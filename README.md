GetActive helps university students overcome the challenge of finding and joining social or recreational groups. It offers a platform to discover, create, and join on-campus activities, making it easier to build connections. Students can register, verify their accounts, and manage their participation in multiple activities. The goal is to promote an active, socially connected campus experience.
